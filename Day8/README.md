# Day 8: Reusing Infrastructure with Modules

## Overview

Welcome to Day 8 of the Terraform 30-Day Challenge! Today, we will focus on creating and using reusable Terraform modules. Modules are an essential part of making your Terraform code scalable and reusable, allowing you to structure infrastructure deployments in a more modular way. By the end of today, you will have created your own module and deployed infrastructure using it.

## Tasks for Today

### 1. **Reading**
   - **Chapter**: Complete Chapter 4 (Pages 115-139)
     - Sections: "Module Basics", "Inputs", and "Outputs".
   - **Goal**: Understand how to create reusable modules in Terraform, define input variables, and output values from modules.

### 2. **Videos**
   - **Udemy**: Watch the following videos:
     - Video 35: "Terraform Modules"
     - Video 36: "Terraform modules - sources"
     - Video 37: "Terraform modules - Input and Output"
   - **Goal**: Learn the fundamentals of working with modules in Terraform and how to structure your code for reusability.

### 3. **Activity**
   - **Create a Module**: Build a basic Terraform module for a common infrastructure component (e.g., an EC2 instance, a VPC, or a load balancer).
   - **Deploy Infrastructure Using the Module**: Use your newly created module to deploy infrastructure in a real environment (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).
   - **Goal**: Successfully create a reusable Terraform module and use it to deploy infrastructure.

### 5. **Blog Post**
   - **Title**: "Building Reusable Infrastructure with Terraform Modules"

### 6. **Social Media Post**
   - **Text**: "ðŸ”„ Implemented reusable Terraform modules today! #HUG #hashicorp #HUGYDE @chiche #IaC"

## How to Submit Your Work

### 1. **Create the `day8-update-your-github-username.md` File**
   - Include your Terraform code and any architecture diagrams in the markdown file.
   - Document your Terraform module, including the inputs, outputs, and how itâ€™s used.
   - Save the file in your `day8-reusable-modules` branch.

### 2. **Commit Your Changes**
   - Stage and commit your changes with a message like:
     ```bash
     git add day8-update-your-github-username.md
     git commit -m "Completed Day 8 task on creating reusable modules"
     ```

### 3. **Create a Pull Request**
   - Push your changes to your GitHub repository:
     ```bash
     git push origin day8-reusable-modules
     ```
   - Create a pull request using the provided template and include any additional comments if necessary.
