### Understanding Terraform State Part 2

i. I learned about migrating state files from local backend to S3 backend or Remote Enhanced backend.

ii. I also learned about locking files and also applying your terraform in the "terraform cloud" user interface and having it work on your cli

iii. I Learned about running "terraform apply" on the terminal and having it trigger a run on the "terraform cloud", giving you the feel of Github Actions and the use of environment variables for secret keys
