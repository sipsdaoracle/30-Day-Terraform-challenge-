# Day 2: Setting Up Terraform

## Overview

Welcome to Day 2 of the Terraform 30-Day Challenge! Today, weâ€™ll focus on setting up Terraform, configuring your AWS environment, and installing essential tools. These steps are crucial as they set the foundation for deploying and managing infrastructure as code.

## Tasks for Today

### 1. **Reading**
   - **Book**: Chapter 2 of "Terraform: Up & Running" by Yevgeniy Brikman.
   - **Sections**: "Setting Up Your AWS Account", "Installing Terraform", and "Configuring VS Code"
   - **Goal**: Learn how to set up your AWS account, install Terraform locally, and configure your development environment.

### 2. **Videos**
   - **Udemy**: Watch the following videos:
     - "Video 7: Setting Up AWS"
     - "Video 8: Installing Terraform"
     - "Video 9: Configuring Terraform"
     - "Video 10: Your First Terraform Script"
   - **Goal**: Gain hands-on experience with setting up Terraform and your AWS environment. Complete the labs associated with videos 7 and 8.

### 3. **Activities**
   - **Set Up Your AWS Account**: Follow the instructions to create and configure your AWS account.
   - **Install Terraform Locally**: Download and install Terraform on your local machine.

"
   - **Goal**: Engage with the community by sharing your progress on social media.

### 6. **Bonus Activity**
   - **Create Infrastructure Diagrams**: Use [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) to create diagrams of the infrastructure setups youâ€™ll be working on. This will help you better understand the architecture and visualize your deployments.
