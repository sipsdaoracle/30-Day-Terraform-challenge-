# Day 12: Zero-Downtime Deployment with Terraform

## Overview

Welcome to Day 12 of the Terraform 30-Day Challenge! Today, you will learn how to implement zero-downtime deployment strategies using Terraform. This is a critical skill for deploying infrastructure updates without causing service interruptions, particularly for applications that need to stay live during deployments. You will explore techniques like blue/green deployments and load balancer management to ensure seamless updates.

## Tasks for Today

### 1. **Reading**
   - **Chapter**: Complete Chapter 5 (Pages 169-189)
     - Section: "Zero-Downtime Deployment Techniques".
   - **Goal**: Understand the key concepts and techniques behind zero-downtime deployments, such as blue/green deployment and canary releases.

### 2. **Videos**
   - **Udemy**: At this point, you have to cover the core of Terraform head over to section 9 and watch the video on Terraform workflow 
    
   - **Goal**: ensure that you brush up your skills in terraform workflow 

### 3. **Activity**
   - **Zero-Downtime Deployment**: Use Terraform to deploy infrastructure updates with zero downtime. Implement blue/green deployment strategies or canary releases using load balancers and carefully manage updates to your web application.
   - **Goal**: Successfully deploy a web application update without causing downtime, using techniques like blue/green deployments.

### 4. **Blog Post**
   - **Title**: "Mastering Zero-Downtime Deployments with Terraform"

### 5. **Social Media Post**
   - **Text**: "ðŸš€ Successfully deployed a zero-downtime update using Terraform! #30daytfchallenge #HUG #hashicorp #HUGYDE @Chi Che. #IaC #terraform"

### 7. **Activity**
   - **Screencast**: Record a screencast of your zero-downtime deployment process and share it on YouTube. Walk through your Terraform code and explain how blue/green or canary deployments work in practice.

## How to Submit Your Work

### 1. **Create the `day12-update-your-github-username.md` File**
   - Include your Terraform code and any architecture diagrams in the markdown file.
   - Document your zero-downtime deployment process, including blue/green deployments or canary releases, and any lessons learned.
   - Save the file in your `day12-zero-downtime` branch.

### 2. **Commit Your Changes**
   - Stage and commit your changes with a message like:
     ```bash
     git add day12-update-your-github-username.md
     git commit -m "Completed Day 12 task on zero-downtime deployment"
     ```

### 3. **Create a Pull Request**
   - Push your changes to your GitHub repository:
     ```bash
     git push origin day12-zero-downtime
     ```
   - Create a pull request using the provided template and include any additional comments if necessary.
