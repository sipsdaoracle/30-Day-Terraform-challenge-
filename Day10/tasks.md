# Day 10: Terraform Loops and Conditionals

## Task Description

1. **Reading**: Chapter 5 (Pages 141-160)
   - Sections: "Loops with `count` and `for_each`", "Conditionals with Terraform".
2. **Udemy Videos**: 
   - section 11 (input/output variables with dynamic blocks)
3. **Activity**:
   - Refactor your existing Terraform code to use loops and conditionals.
   - Use `count` to deploy multiple instances of the same resource, and use `for_each` to iterate over maps or lists of resources.
   - Implement conditional logic to deploy resources based on input variables.
4. **Blog Post Ideas**: 
   - "Mastering Loops and Conditionals in Terraform"
   - "How Loops and Conditionals Simplify Infrastructure as Code with Terraform"
5. **Social Media Post**: 
   - "ðŸ’¡ Learned how to use loops and conditionals in Terraform for dynamic deployments! #TerraformChallenge #Automation"
