# Day 13: Managing Sensitive Data in Terraform

## Overview

Welcome to Day 13 of the Terraform 30-Day Challenge! Today, we focus on one of the most critical aspects of infrastructure as code: managing sensitive data securely. Handling sensitive information like passwords, API keys, and tokens requires careful planning to avoid exposing these secrets in your Terraform configurations and state files. By the end of today, you will understand how to securely manage sensitive data using tools like Vault or AWS Secrets Manager.

## Tasks for Today

### 5. **Blog Post**
   - **Title**: "How to Handle Sensitive Data Securely in Terraform"

### 6. **Social Media Post**
   - **Text**: "üîê Configured secure management of sensitive data in Terraform today! #30daytfchallenge #HUG #hashicorp #HUGYDE @Chi Che. #IaC #terraform"

### 7. **Activity**
   - **Advanced Guide**: Write an advanced guide on secure secrets management across multiple cloud environments. Include examples, best practices, and a step-by-step walkthrough. Share this guide on GitHub to help others implement secure secrets management in their Terraform workflows.

## How to Submit Your Work

### 1. **Create the `day13-update-your-github-username.md` File**
   - Include your Terraform code and any architecture diagrams in the markdown file.
   - Document your secure secrets management setup, including how you integrated Vault or AWS Secrets Manager into your Terraform workflows.
   - Save the file in your `day13-secure-secrets` branch.

### 2. **Commit Your Changes**
   - Stage and commit your changes with a message like:
     ```bash
     git add day13-update-your-github-username.md
     git commit -m "Completed Day 13 task on secure secrets management"
     ```

### 3. **Create a Pull Request**
   - Push your changes to your GitHub repository:
     ```bash
     git push origin day13-secure-secrets
     ```
   - Create a pull request using the provided template and include any additional comments if necessary.
