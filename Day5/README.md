Welcome to Day 5 of the Terraform 30-Day Challenge! Today, we will focus on scaling your infrastructure and deepening your understanding of Terraform's state. You'll learn about scaling your infrastructure to handle increased load, understand the importance of state in Terraform, and explore how to manage state effectively. the key learnig objective today is understanding how the defferent block work together.

## Tasks for Today

### 1. **Reading**
   - **Chapter**: Complete Chapter 2 and start Chapter 3 how to manage Terraform state.
     - Sections: "Scaling Infrastructure" and "Terraform State".
   - **Goal**: Understand the concepts of scaling infrastructure and the importance of managing Terraform state.

### 2. **Videos**
   - **Udemy**: Watch the following videos:
