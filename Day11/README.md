# Day 11: Terraform Conditionals

## Overview

Welcome to Day 11 of the Terraform 30-Day Challenge! Today, we will focus on mastering Terraform conditionals. Conditionals allow you to deploy resources dynamically based on input variables or specific conditions. This is an advanced technique that makes your Terraform configurations more efficient and flexible. By the end of today, you'll have a strong grasp of how to implement conditionals to control the behavior of your infrastructure deployments.

## Tasks for Today

### 1. **Reading**
   - **Chapter**: Complete Chapter 5 (Pages 160-169)
     - Sections: "Conditionals with Terraform".
   - **Goal**: Understand how to implement conditional logic within your Terraform configurations to control resource deployments based on input variables or specific criteria.

### 2. **Videos**
   - **Udemy**: Rewatch day 10 vidoes the following videos:
     - Variable Collection and Structure Types
     - Working with Data Blocks
     - Terraform Built-in Functions
   - **Goal**: Learn how to use variables, data blocks, and built-in functions alongside conditionals to create more flexible and reusable Terraform configurations.

### 3. **Activity**
   - **Modify Existing Code**: Refactor your existing Terraform code to use conditionals for dynamic deployments. Use conditional expressions to deploy resources only when certain criteria are met (e.g., specific regions, environment flags, or resource requirements).
   - **Goal**: Successfully implement conditionals in your Terraform code, making your deployments more adaptable to varying conditions.

### 4. **Blog Post**
   - **Title**: "Mastering Loops and Conditionals in Terraform"

### 5. **Social Media Post**
   - **Text**: "ðŸ’¡ Learned how to use loops and conditionals in Terraform for dynamic deployments! #TerraformChallenge #Automation"

## How to Submit Your Work

### 1. **Create the `day11-update-your-github-username.md` File**
   - Include your Terraform code and any architecture diagrams in the markdown file.
   - Document your refactored Terraform code that uses conditionals, and explain how the conditionals impacted your infrastructure deployment.
   - Save the file in your `day11-conditionals` branch.

### 2. **Commit Your Changes**
   - Stage and commit your changes with a message like:
     ```bash
     git add day11-update-your-github-username.md
     git commit -m "Completed Day 11 task on Terraform conditionals"
     ```

### 3. **Create a Pull Request**
   - Push your changes to your GitHub repository:
     ```bash
     git push origin day11-conditionals
     ```
   - Create a pull request using the provided template and include any additional comments if necessary.
