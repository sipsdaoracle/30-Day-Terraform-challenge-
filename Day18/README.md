# Day 18: Automated Testing of Terraform Code

## Overview

Welcome to Day 18 of the Terraform 30-Day Challenge! Today, we will dive into the world of automated testing for Terraform code. Automated tests are crucial for maintaining confidence in your infrastructure as it evolves. Weâ€™ll cover unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests, which are key to ensuring your Terraform code works as expected across different environments.

## Tasks for Today

### 1. **Reading**
   - **Chapter**: Complete Chapter 9 of "Terraform: Up & Running"
     - Sections: "Automated Tests", "Unit Tests", "Integration Tests", "End-to-End Tests", "Other Testing Approaches".
   - **Goal**: Understand the different types of automated tests for Terraform and how they can be implemented to validate infrastructure code.

### 2. **Videos**
   - **Udemy**: Rewatch videos from Section 7 that cover testing, focusing on automated Debugging terraform.
   - **Goal**: Gain insights into best practices for automating tests for your Terraform code.

### 3. **Activity**
   - **Automated Testing**:
     - Implement unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests for a Terraform project using tools like Terratest.
     - Ensure that your tests cover key infrastructure components and that they can be run automatically in a CI/CD pipeline.
   - **Goal**: Successfully set up automated testing for your Terraform code, ensuring that it is reliable and robust across different scenarios.

### 4. **Bonus Hands-On Project**
   - **Goal**: Set up a CI/CD pipeline that automatically runs your Terraform tests whenever changes are pushed to your repository. Ensure that your pipeline is capable of detecting and reporting any issues with your infrastructure code.
   - **Deliverables**: Share your CI/CD pipeline setup and Terraform tests on GitHub, along with documentation on how to replicate the setup.

### 5. **Blog Post**
   - **Title**: "Automating Terraform Testing: From Unit Tests to End-to-End Validation"

### 6. **Social Media Post**
   - **Text**: "ðŸš€ Automated testing for my Terraform code is now up and runningâ€”confidence in infrastructure has never been higher! #30daytfchallenge #HUG #hashicorp #HUGYDE @Chi Che. #IaC #terraform"

## How to Submit Your Work

### 1. **Create the `day18-update-your-github-username.md` File**
   - Include a summary of your automated testing setup, along with any code and CI/CD pipeline configurations.
   - Save the file in your `day18-automated-testing` branch.

### 2. **Commit Your Changes**
   - Stage and commit your changes with a message like:
     ```bash
     git add day18-update-your-github-username.md
     git commit -m "Completed Day 18 task on automated testing"
     ```

### 3. **Create a Pull Request**
   - Push your changes to your GitHub repository:
     ```bash
     git push origin day18-automated-testing
     ```
   - Create a pull request using the provided template and include any additional comments if necessary.
