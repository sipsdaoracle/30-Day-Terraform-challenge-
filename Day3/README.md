## Overview

Welcome to Day 3 of the Terraform 30-Day Challenge! Today, we're diving into deploying basic infrastructure using Terraform. You'll learn about Terraform's provider and resource blocks and gain hands-on experience by deploying your first server.

## Tasks for Today

### 1. **Reading**
   - **Chapter**: Chapter 2 
     - Sections: "Deploying a Single Server" and "Deploying a Web Server". you should end at page 59
   - **Goal**: Understand what a provider block and a resource block are, and learn how to design and deploy a web server on AWS, GCP, or Azure.

### 2. **Videos**
   - **Udemy**: Watch the following videos:
     - "Terraform Plug-in Based Architecture" (Video 11)
     - "Provider Block" (Video 12)
     - "Resource Block" (Video 13)
   - **Goal**: you should be able to explain what is a plug-in based architecture and also what is a provider and resource block to a 5-year-old 

### 3. **Activity**
   - **Deploy a Basic Server**: Use Terraform to deploy a basic web server on AWS, GCP, or Azure. 
   - **Design the Architecture**: Create an architecture diagram for your web server using [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/). Taking into consideration the cloud platform you are using 
   - **Goal**: Successfully deploy your first server and visualize the architecture.
   - **Bonus**: You can animate your architecture with PowerPoint.

### 4. **Blog Post idea **
   - **Title**: "Deploying Your First Server with Terraform: A Beginner's Guide"

### 5. **Social Media Post**
   - **Text**: "ðŸ”¥ Deployed my first server using Terraform today! Itâ€™s amazing how simple IaC makes this.#30daytfchallenge #HUG #hashicorp #HUGYDE @Chi Che. #IaC #terraform
"

### 6. **Video Tutorial (Optional)**
   - **Activity**: Create a video tutorial or screen recording of your deployment process and share it on YouTube or LinkedIn.
   - **Goal**: Help others learn by sharing your experience.
