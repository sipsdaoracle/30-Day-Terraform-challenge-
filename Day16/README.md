# Day 16: Building Production-Grade Infrastructure

## Overview

Welcome to Day 16 of the Terraform 30-Day Challenge! Today, we're stepping up our game by learning how to build production-grade infrastructure using Terraform. Building production-ready Terraform code requires a deep understanding of best practices, including creating modular, testable, and composable configurations. By the end of today, you will have refactored an existing infrastructure project to meet the standards of a production environment.

## Tasks for Today

### 1. **Reading**
   - **Chapter**: Complete Chapter 8 of "Terraform: Up & Running" (Pages 275-313)
     - Sections: "The Production-Grade Infrastructure Checklist", "Building Testable and Composable Modules".
   - **Goal**: Understand the essential elements that make Terraform code production-ready, focusing on best practices for module design, versioning, and testability.

### 2. **Videos**
   - **Udemy**: Watch the following videos:
     - rewatch the videos on modules section 8
   - **Goal**: Learn how to design and implement Terraform infrastructure that meets the rigorous demands of a production environment.

### 3. **Activity**
   - **Refactor Infrastructure**: Take an existing Terraform project and refactor it to meet production-grade standards. This includes:
     - Breaking down configurations into small, composable, and reusable modules.
     - Implementing version control for your modules.
     - Ensuring that your modules are testable and can be easily integrated into CI/CD pipelines.
   - **Goal**: Successfully refactor the infrastructure to make it suitable for a production environment, focusing on modularity, testability, and maintainability.

### 4. **Blog Post**
   - **Title**: "Creating Production-Grade Infrastructure with Terraform"

### 5. **Social Media Post**
   - **Text**: "ðŸš€ Built my first production-grade infrastructure using Terraform today! #30daytfchallenge #HUG #hashicorp #HUGYDE @Chi Che. #IaC #terraform
"


## How to Submit Your Work

### 1. **Create the `day16-update-your-github-username.md` File**
   - Include your refactored Terraform code and any architecture diagrams in the markdown file.
   - Document the changes you made to bring the infrastructure up to production-grade standards, including module design, versioning, and testing strategies.
   - Save the file in your `day16-production-grade` branch.

### 2. **Commit Your Changes**
   - Stage and commit your changes with a message like:
     ```bash
     git add day16-update-your-github-username.md
     git commit -m "Completed Day 16 task on building production-grade infrastructure"
     ```

### 3. **Create a Pull Request**
   - Push your changes to your GitHub repository:
     ```bash
     git push origin day16-production-grade
     ```
   - Create a pull request using the provided template and include any additional comments if necessary.
