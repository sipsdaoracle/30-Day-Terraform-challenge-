# Day 14: Working with Multiple Providers - Part 1

## Overview

Welcome to Day 14 of the Terraform 30-Day Challenge! Today, we will dive into Chapter 7 of "Terraform: Up & Running," which covers working with multiple providers. Providers are essential components in Terraform, allowing you to interact with different infrastructure platforms like AWS, GCP, Azure, Docker, and Kubernetes. Understanding how to work with multiple providers, including multiple copies of the same provider, is key to managing complex, multi-cloud infrastructures.

## Tasks for Today

### 1. **Reading**
   - **Chapter**: Begin Chapter 7 of "Terraform: Up & Running"
     - Sections: "Working with One Provider", "What Is a Provider?", "How Do You Install Providers?", "How Do You Use Providers?", "Working with Multiple Copies of the Same Provider".
   - **Goal**: Understand the basics of Terraform providers, how to install and use them, and how to work with multiple copies of the same provider.

### 2. **Videos**
   - **Udemy**: Watch the following videos:
     - Video 15: "Provider block"
     - Video 24: "Provider installation and visioning"
     - Video 25: "using multiple providers "
   - **Goal**: Learn the concepts of working with multiple providers in Terraform and prepare for more complex, multi-provider setups.

### 3. **Activity**
   - **Provider Configuration**: Set up Terraform configurations that use multiple copies of the same provider, such as deploying resources in multiple AWS regions or accounts. Experiment with using provider aliases and understanding the role of provider versions.
   - **Goal**: Successfully deploy resources across multiple regions or accounts using multiple copies of the same provider.

### 4. **Preparation for Tomorrow**
   - **Rewatch**: Rewatch the videos on Terraform modules to prepare for creating modules that can work with multiple providers in tomorrowâ€™s session.

### 5. **Blog Post**
   - **Title**: "Getting Started with Multiple Providers in Terraform"

### 6. **Social Media Post**
   - **Text**: "ðŸ”§ Learned how to manage multiple providers in Terraform todayâ€”getting ready to scale my infrastructure across multiple regions and accounts! #30daytfchallenge #HUG #hashicorp #HUGYDE @Chi Che. #IaC #terraform"
