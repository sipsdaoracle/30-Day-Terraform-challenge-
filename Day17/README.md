# Day 17: Manual Testing of Terraform Code

## Overview

Welcome to Day 17 of the Terraform 30-Day Challenge! Today, we‚Äôll dive into the first part of testing Terraform code‚Äîmanual testing. Testing is a crucial part of any infrastructure as code (IaC) practice because it helps reduce the risks associated with deploying changes. By mastering manual testing, you‚Äôll gain confidence in the changes you make to your Terraform configurations, ensuring they work as expected before deploying to production.

## Tasks for Today

### 1. **Reading**
   - **Chapter**: Start Chapter 9 of "Terraform: Up & Running"
     - Sections: "Manual Tests", "Manual Testing Basics", "Cleaning Up After Tests".
   - **Goal**: Understand the fundamentals of manual testing, why it‚Äôs important, and how to properly clean up your environment after tests.

### 2. **Videos**
   - **Udemy**: Rewatch the videos from Section 7 on testing.
   - **Goal**: Refresh your understanding of the concepts related to testing Terraform code.

### 3. **Activity**
   - **Manual Testing**: Choose an existing Terraform configuration and perform manual tests on it. This could include:
     - Verifying that resources are created correctly.
     - Checking that the infrastructure behaves as expected in different environments.
     - Ensuring that your changes do not introduce regressions.
   - **Cleanup**: After testing, ensure that all resources are properly cleaned up to avoid unnecessary costs and potential conflicts.
   - **Goal**: Successfully perform manual tests on a Terraform configuration and clean up the environment afterward.

### 4. **Blog Post**
   - **Title**: "The Importance of Manual Testing in Terraform"

### 5. **Social Media Post**
   - **Text**: "üîç Spent the day diving into manual testing for Terraform code‚Äîan essential step in ensuring infrastructure stability before deploying to production! #30daytfchallenge #HUG #hashicorp #HUGYDE @Chi Che. #IaC #terraform
"

### 6. **Activity**
   - **Documentation**: Document the steps you took during manual testing, including any issues you encountered and how you resolved them. This documentation can be invaluable for future testing and for sharing with your team.

## How to Submit Your Work

### 1. **Create the `day17-update-your-github-username.md` File**
   - Include your Terraform code, testing steps, and any issues or findings in the markdown file.
   - Document the cleanup process after testing.
   - Save the file in your `day17-manual-testing` branch.

### 2. **Commit Your Changes**
   - Stage and commit your changes with a message like:
     ```bash
     git add day17-update-your-github-username.md
     git commit -m "Completed Day 17 task on manual testing of Terraform code"
     ```

### 3. **Create a Pull Request**
   - Push your changes to your GitHub repository:
     ```bash
     git push origin day17-manual-testing
     ```
   - Create a pull request using the provided template and include any additional comments if necessary.
